    <p>Story</p>
    <h1>
      In a forgotten realm, shrouded in eternal darkness, there existed a mysterious forest known as Darkwood. Its gnarled trees stood like ancient sentinels, whispering secrets to the wind and casting eerie shadows upon the forest floor. None dared to venture into its depths, for it was said that Darkwood was home to unspeakable horrors and malevolent spirits.<br>

      It was within this enigmatic realm that Sparrow, a young and curious girl, found herself drawn. Sparrow was a solitary soul, possessing an insatiable appetite for adventure and an unyielding curiosity that often led her astray. Her jet-black hair cascaded down her back like a waterfall of shadows, her eyes shimmering with an otherworldly glow that hinted at her connection to the mystical.<br>

      Driven by an unexplainable force, Sparrow left her mundane life behind and ventured into the heart of Darkwood. As she stepped foot into the forest, an eerie silence enveloped her. The air turned heavy, and the once familiar sounds of nature ceased to exist. She pressed forward, undeterred by the ominous ambiance, as if guided by an unseen hand.<br>

      It was then that she stumbled upon a clearing, bathed in moonlight. In the center stood a peculiar girl known as Raven, clad in a tattered black dress that mirrored the feathers of her namesake. Her porcelain skin was pale, almost translucent, and her eyes were deep pools of obsidian. Raven possessed an uncanny beauty, entwined with an aura of darkness that sent shivers down Sparrow's spine.<br>

      Raven beckoned Sparrow forward with a slender finger, her voice a haunting melody. Sparrow, entranced by the enigmatic girl, succumbed to her allure and approached cautiously. The Raven girl spoke of forbidden knowledge and untold secrets, tempting Sparrow with promises of power and wisdom beyond mortal comprehension.<br>

      Unbeknownst to Sparrow, she had fallen into the possession of the Raven girl, becoming entangled in a web of enchantment from which escape seemed impossible. The forest conspired against her, twisting and turning, leading her deeper into its heart, where shadows danced and whispered with malicious intent.<br>

      With each passing day, Sparrow felt her spirit dimming, her once vibrant essence fading into the darkness. The forest's grip tightened around her, ensnaring her every step and whispering wicked thoughts into her mind. She became a puppet, dancing to the Raven girl's sinister whims.<br>

      But deep within Sparrow's heart, a glimmer of her former self remained. The spark of defiance ignited, fueling her determination to break free from the Raven girl's clutches. She embarked on a perilous journey through the labyrinthine maze of Darkwood, facing treacherous trials and malevolent entities that sought to keep her forever entwined in their wicked realm.<br>

      With every trial overcome, Sparrow grew stronger, her spirit shining brighter than ever before. She unraveled the Raven girl's true intentions, realizing that the power offered was but an illusion, a trap designed to consume her soul. Sparrow resolved to sever the ties that bound her, to break free from the grasp of the forest and its wicked mistress.<br>

      At the heart of Darkwood, amidst the deepest shadows, Sparrow confronted the Raven girl. Their battle was a symphony of darkness and light, a clash of wills that reverberated through the ancient trees. Sparrow tapped into her inner strength
